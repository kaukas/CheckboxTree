jQuery CheckboxTree
===================

A jQuery plugin that displays a tree of items. The items have checkboxes and
some complex logic how the selections are handled.

TODO
----

- make it faster for wide and deep structures (drawing and getSelected)
- cache getSelected
- simplify the API
- separate the state from the DOM
- use $.widget as a base (?)
